what is super keyword:
    super keyword in java is used to refer to the parent class object.
why should use we learn super keyword.
   1) if we have same name variable or method in the super /parent /base class.then we can use the super keyword to refer to
    parent class variable or method because by default java prefers the variable of child class.
    we can also call the super class constructor with the help of super with parenthesis super();
how to use super keyword:
    1) we can use super method name or field name to call the method or to access the field if super class
    2)use the super with parenthesis to call the super class constructor
Rules:
     1)we can only access the immediate parent class constructor or field or method
     with the help of super keyword .
     2) we can only use super() inside a constructor.
     3) if we have a user created constructor in the parent class we must have a matching constructor
     4) if we have multiple constructor inside the parent as soon as one is matched we are good to go
     5)super() should be the first line inside a constructor.

what is Method OverLoading:
     When same name method exist in a class but with different number of parameters or different
     type of parameters or different sequence of parameters it is called methodOverloading.
why we should use methodOverloading:
     1)Makes you code more readable.
     2)Makes the life of the end users easy they don't have to memorize many method names.
How we can use methodOverloading.
     we can have same name methods but we have to follow the below rules.
     1) by passing different number of parameters
     2) we can change the datatype of parameters
     3) we can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters.
