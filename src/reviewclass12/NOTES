What is List in Java:
    1)It allows us to store duplicates.
    2)insertion order is maintained.
ArrayList and linkedList are two most popular implementation of this interface
ArrayList:
     When 90% of the operations are related to retrieval then we should use ArrayList.
LinkedList:
     when 90% of the operations are manipulation(adding and deleting) operation from any where inside the
     list then we should use LinkedList.
Set:
  Sets does not allow duplicates values.
Most popular classes that have implemented Set interface.
     1)HashSet   2)LinkedHashSet  3)TreeSet.
HashSet:
    Upside:
          Insertion and retrieval is fastest of all other sets.
    Downside:
         Insertion order is not maintained.
LinkedHashSet:
        Upside:
              It maintains the insertion order.
        Downside:
               slower than Hashset  but faster than TreeSet.
               Retrieval speed is slowest of all.
TreeSet:
      Upside:
           Stores the data in the sorted form.
      Downside:
           Insertion speed is slowest of all.
           Retrieval speed better than LinkedHashSet but slower than the HashSet.
Map interface in java:
    Map allows us to store key value pairs.
Most popular classes that implement the Map interface are;
    1)HashMap  2)LinkedHashMap  3) TreeMap

  HashMap:
    Upside:
          fastest when it comes to insertion and retrieval.
    Downside:
           No insertion order is maintained.

  LinkedHashMap:
          Upside:
               Insertion order is maintained.
          Downside:
               slower than Hashset  but faster than TreeSet.
               Retrieval speed is slowest of all.
