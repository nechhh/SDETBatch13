What is a List:
      List is an interface inside the collections framework which have below properties
          1) Insertion order is maintained.
          2) I can store duplicate data.
   List is implemented by many classes but we will be focusing on ArrayList and linkedList:
ArrayList:
         When my requirement is that i will be reading the data a lot then i should be going with ArrayList.
LinkedList:
          Most of our operation will be writing the data to a list in between or in the start or shifting
          the data we should be going with LinkedList.
Iterator:
        is an interface that has three methods;
                                              hasNext()
                                              next()
                                              remove()
        whenever we try to modify the size of a list using simple loop there are changes that it will
        not work or will throw an error because Lists are dynamic and can change the size at runtime
        so to be always on the safe side we should use Iterators.

Set:
   1)Duplicates are not allowed
   We will be discussing three types of sets:
     1) HashSet
     2)LinkedHashset
     3)TreeSet
HashSet:
       Upside:
             it is the fastest of all
       Downside:
               No Insertion order is maintained but
Linked/HashSet:
              Upside:
                    Insertion order is maintained
              Downside:
                      Retrieval of element will be super super slow
                      Insertion speed is slower than HashSet
ThreeSet:
        Upside:
              Elements will  always be sorted form
        DownSide:
                Insertion speed is slower than of all
                Retrieval speed better than LinkedList but slower than HashSet

 Map:
    Map is an interface in java that allow us to store key value pairs
    we can not have duplicate keys but we can have duplicate values
    we will discussing 3 of them
      1) HashMaP
      2)LinkedHashMap
      3)TreeMap

  HashMap:
        Upside:
              fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the elements
        DownSide:
                No insertion order
  LinkedHashMap:
               Upside:
                     Insertion order will be maintained
               DownSide:
                       Retrieval will be slowest
  TreeMap:
         Upside:
               data will be stored in the sorted form based on keys
         DownSide:
                  Insertion is slowest
