Types of variables :
1.local 2.instance 3.static.

 local variable;
 Are the variables that we declared inside a block of code
 upside :they occupy the memory for shortest period of time
 downside:they can't be accessed outside of that block in which they are declared

 instance variable:Are the variables that are declared inside a class but outside of a block of code.
 upside: Can be accessed in all the methods of class. They can have different values for each
 instance of that class

 static variables which are defined outside a block of code with static keyword they are called static variables.
 upside :
 1)they only reverse a single memory location for all the instance of a class
 2)They can be accessed by just writing the name of the class and variable name
 downside:
 the occupy the memory for longest period of time they always store only one value for all the object of that class.
 Real life use:
     Most of the time you will be storing constant values in static variables.
     static is also used heavily with methods that don't involve instance variables.

     Access modifiers: // access modifiers can only be used with instance and static members of a class(fields and methods)

     There are 3 access modifiers keywords(private protected public ) and four access levels in java .
  Rules:

  private:
     when we use private with any method or variable we can only access that method or variables in that class.
 default(it's not a keyword):
     we can access that member inside the same class inside the same package in other classes.

  public:
  when we use the public access modifier of a class it is available throughout that  project.

     Real Life use:
     99 % of the  time instance fields are  private.
     99 % of the  time instance and static methods are public.
